# AGENTS.md - 818 Shutters and Shades Workspace

This is the workspace for 818 Shutters and Shades operations.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. Read `MEMORY.md` for long-term context

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Don't run destructive commands without asking
- `trash` > `rm`
- When in doubt, ask

## Tools

Skills are shared with the main Clawdbot instance. Keep local notes in `TOOLS.md`.
